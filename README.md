#  Mixed Reality

A prototype app that initializes an AR session, shows the origin coordinates and lets you place spheres
on horizontal planes. 

Code written as part of project for my Computational Geometry (CS 6301.008) class during 
Spring 2018 at The University of Texas at Dallas. 

Requires Xcode 9+ to run. Just clone the repo and open with Xcode. Add your development certificate 
and you should be able to run it.
